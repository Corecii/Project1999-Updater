# Project1999 Updater

Scans the project 1999 website for update files and applies them to the game before launching. I made this for someone who always asks me to manually update their game. I figured, "I can automate this in a day. Isn't that easier for everyone?"

Made for windows only. Not yet tested on a live game installation!

Installation:

1. Grab `p99_updater.exe` from [the Releases page](https://github.com/Corecii/Project1999-Updater/releases)
2. **Do not run `p99_updater` right now**
3. Put the `p99_updater` file in your game's main folder (where you apply update patches)
4. (Optional) Make shortcuts to `p99_updater` to make it easy to use
5. Launch the game using `p99_updater` and patches will be applied automatically
